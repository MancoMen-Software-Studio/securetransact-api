## C4 Model

We use the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) for visualizing the software architecture:

1. **Context** - Shows how SecureTransact fits in the world
2. **Container** - High-level technology choices
3. **Component** - Internal structure of containers
4. **Code** - Implementation details (optional)

## Architecture Decision Records

ADRs document significant architectural decisions. Each ADR follows this format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: Why we need to make this decision
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Consequences**: What happens as a result
